Jerome Hylton's Portfolio Project

Background:
The way in which my portfolio was set up differs from the typical full stack web development student in that I am a technical project manager looking to formalize my technical skills with the addition of the Concordia Web Development Diploma Program.

Contents:
My portfolio was split into 6 component files that paved the way for each section of the webpage:

1. Header
2. Hero Section
3. About Me Section
4. Expertise Section
5. Projects Section
6. Get In Touch Section

For the Projects Section, I also created a data.js file that held all the various project information in a an object that I mapped through and rendered in the projects section of the webpage

I also created hashlinks in the "Header" section that scroll to the particular section of the page when clicked.

Finally I made my webpage dynamic in the sense that it can be viewed from any device and rendered properly. I leveraged view height/width, media queries and flex boxes to achieve the website scaling.

Closing:

I will continue to add to my website as I hone my web development skills but I hope you enjoy what I have created thus far!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
